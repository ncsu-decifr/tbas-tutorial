# Tutorial 3: Uploading and creating a custom T-BAS reference tree with alignments and specimen metadata, and option to place unknown sequences and metadata

1. In this tutorial we will be uploading a custom reference tree and all of the files that are needed to perform a placement of unknown sequences on that tree. We will use the Ramularia reference tree and files that are available in [TreeBase](https://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/search/studySearch.html). For your convenience we made these files available as links in the tutorial. They can be downloaded by searching for the S16754 study ID in [TreeBase](https://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/search/studySearch.html) and retrieving the original [tree](http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/tree/TB2:Tr79968?format=nexus) and [alignment](https://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/search/downloadANexusFile.html?id=16754&treeid=79968) files. The specimen metadata was extracted from Table 1 in [Videira et al. 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4510271/). To begin, go to the T-BAS start page (https://tbas.hpc.ncsu.edu/start) and click on the Upload Tree button (see arrow).
