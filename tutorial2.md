# Tutorial 2: Phylogeny-based placement of unknown sequences, de novo phylogenetic reconstruction of subtrees and haplotype network inference

1. In this tutorial we will be using the Ramularia reference tree as an example to illustrate the placement features available in T-BAS. To begin, go to the T-BAS start page (https://tbas.hpc.ncsu.edu/start) and click on the T-BAS Trees button (see arrow).

2. Click on the blue bullet to select the Ramularia reference tree. Note only trees with a solid blue bullet in the guide tree contain data. References for each tree are provided under the Citations menu. We advise users to refer to the original papers for details on the specific primers that were used for amplification and sequencing of the Loci included in T-BAS.

3.  The Ramularia tree is now highlighted in red.  Below the guide tree are options (blue buttons) for View Tree Data (i.e., viewing/downloading of tree, alignments and specimen metadata), and Place Unknowns (i.e., phylogenetic placement of unknown sequences).
