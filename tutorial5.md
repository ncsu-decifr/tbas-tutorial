# Tutorial 5: Phylogeny-based placement of unknown sequences and specimen metadata on a custom reference tree

In this tutorial, the custom reference tree that was created in Tutorial 3 will be used to illustrate how unknowns can be examined using phylogeny-based placement. 
 
1. Before beginning the tutorial, download these two example files: Unknowns ITS file1 and Unknowns metadata. Then go to the T-BAS start page and click on User Trees.
