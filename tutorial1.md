# T-BAS v2.1 Tutorial 1: Viewing Trees, Alignments, and Specimen Metadata

1. In this tutorial we will be using the Ramularia reference tree as an example to illustrate the features available when viewing trees in T-BAS. To begin, go to the T-BAS start page (https://tbas.hpc.ncsu.edu/start) and click on the T-BAS Trees button (see arrow).

3. The Ramularia tree is now highlighted in red.  Below the guide tree are options (blue buttons) for View Tree Data (i.e., viewing/downloading of tree, alignments and specimen metadata), and Place Unknowns (i.e., phylogenetic placement of unknown sequences).
